I decided to recreate the SPCUA maps after being
frustrated with the inabilty to see the numbers at each station well and also
unable to retrieve archived unanalyzed UA maps.  In order to improve the maps,
I decided to make them in color in order to make the values easier to identify
and easier to identify trends as one of my favorite parts of the original maps
were the existance of the height/temperature/dewpoint 12-hour tendencies and
the dewpoint depression information.
<br><br>

    These maps provide 8 different types of data at the UA stations.<br>
    Observations:<br>
    1.) Upper left (black) - geopotential height in meters (truncated)<br>
    2.) Middle left (red) - temperature in Celsius.<br>
    3.) Lower left (green) - dewpoint in Celsius.<br>
    4.) Winds in knots <br>
   
<br>
The geopotential height numbers are truncated differently for different maps.<br>
925 mb - (meters, no numbers needed to be added)<br>
850 mb - (meters, but add a 1 to the front of the number)<br>
700 mb - (meters, but add a 3 to the front of the number)<br>
500 mb - (meters, but add a 0 to the end of the number)<br>
300 mb - (meters, but add a 0 to the end of the number)<br> 
 
<br>
    12 Hour Tendencies:<br>
    1.) Upper right (+ [rises], red | - [falls], blue) - geopotential height tendency (decameters)<br>
    2.) Middle right (+ [warming], red | - [cooling], blue) - temperature tendency (Celsius)<br>
    3.) Lower right (+ [moistening], green | - [drying], orange) - dewpoint tendency (Celsius)<br>
    
<br>
    Lift:<br>
    1.) Dewpoint depression in bold at the top if the dewpoint depression <= 5 Celsius.<br>
